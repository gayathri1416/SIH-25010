## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

## Detailed explanation of the proposed solution

I plan to create <b>Augmented Reality (AR) smart glasses</b> that farmers can wear while working in the fields. 
These glasses will act like a personal assistant, giving real-time advice directly in front of their eyes. 
They will highlight sick plants, suggest treatments, and guide farmers on when to water, what fertilizer to use, and how to handle pests or diseases. 
The glasses will also provide <b>instant weather alerts</b> so farmers can make quick decisions to protect their crops.


## How it addresses the problem

Most small farmers depend on guesswork or advice from others, which often leads to wrong decisions and crop loss. 
With these AR glasses, farmers don’t need to rely on anyone else. They get <b>personalized, location-specific guidance instantly</b> while working. 
This will help reduce the misuse of chemicals, improve crop health, and increase yield. 
It also solves the problem of <b>language barriers and low literacy</b>, because the glasses use <b>simple visuals and voice instructions</b> instead of long text.


## Innovation and uniqueness of the solution

Unlike regular mobile apps or chatbots, this solution is <b>hands-free and more interactive</b>. 
Farmers won’t need to stop their work to check a phone or search for answers. 
The AR glasses make farming advice <b>visible directly on the field in real time</b>, which is more natural and practical. 
This unique approach not only saves time but also makes modern technology accessible to farmers who may not be comfortable with smartphones.


## Technical Approach

## Technologies to be used

I will use <b>Augmented Reality (AR) smart glasses</b> combined with simple mobile connectivity. 
The glasses will display real-time advice with visuals and voice instructions in the farmer’s local language. 
For backend support, basic cloud services will be used to store crop data, weather updates, and pest information. 
Instead of very complex tools, the focus will be on <b>easy-to-use, reliable, and affordable technology</b> that works even in rural areas with limited internet.


## Methodology and process for implementation

The process starts with building a <b>digital crop library</b> that contains information about soil, weather, and pest details for different regions. 
When a farmer uses the glasses, the system will scan the crop, match it with the library, and give suggestions immediately. 
The glasses will also connect with a simple mobile app or web portal where farmers or agricultural officers can update soil reports, 
local weather, and fertilizer recommendations. Over time, the system will learn from the farmer’s usage and give <b>smarter, personalized advice</b>. 
I will test a prototype first on a small group of farmers before expanding widely.


## Feasibility and Viability

Analysis of the feasibility of the idea

The idea is practical because it focuses on using <b>affordable and simple technology</b>. 
Farmers do not need to buy expensive machines or have advanced knowledge to use it. 
The smart glasses can be made cost-effective by reusing existing AR hardware with simplified features, 
and the supporting system can run on basic mobile connectivity. This ensures that even in rural areas, 
the solution can be applied without major obstacles.


## Potential challenges and risks

Some challenges include <b>cost of devices</b>, <b>internet availability</b> in remote areas, 
and <b>training farmers</b> to get comfortable with the glasses. 
There may also be resistance in the beginning as many farmers are used to traditional methods 
and may hesitate to adopt new technology.


## Strategies for overcoming these challenges

To overcome these issues, I can provide the glasses at <b>low cost through government schemes or cooperatives</b>. 
Offline features can be added so that farmers get basic advice even without internet, and the device updates itself whenever it connects online. 
I can also conduct training sessions and demo workshops to help farmers understand the usefulness of the solution. 
Collaboration with local agricultural officers and NGOs can further build trust and ensure wide acceptance.

## Impact and Benefits

## Potential impact on the target audience

The solution will have a strong impact on <b>small and marginal farmers</b> who often struggle to get proper advice. 
By giving them real-time and personalized guidance through AR glasses, they will be able to make quick and correct decisions in their fields. 
This reduces dependency on local shopkeepers or guesswork, and builds farmer confidence in using modern technology. 
It also encourages <b>scientific farming practices</b> in rural areas.


## Benefits of the solution

The benefits are <b>social, economic, and environmental</b>. 
Socially, it empowers farmers by giving them independence and access to modern tools in their own language. 
Economically, it helps reduce unnecessary spending on wrong fertilizers or pesticides and increases crop yield, leading to better income. 
Environmentally, it promotes <b>balanced use of chemicals</b> and supports sustainable farming. 
Overall, the solution improves productivity, protects the environment, and uplifts the livelihood of farming communities.

## Research and References
86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal, making them highly dependent on affordable and localized technology for advisory services (NABARD Report, 2022).

ICT-based advisories can raise yields by 20–30%, showing that digital decision-support directly improves productivity and farmer income.

Deep learning models can accurately detect crop diseases from images, with PlantVillage studies reporting high success rates in field diagnosis.

AR smart glasses have been tested in agriculture to provide hands-free, real-time guidance, showing strong potential for precision farming and usability.
